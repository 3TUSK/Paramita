# Pāramitā

A multi-project template for those who wish to develop a single Minecraft mod on multiple Minecraft versions and 
multiple loaders, altogether in a single place.

The name of this template `Pāramitā` is [IAST][ref-IAST] of Sanskrit पारमिता, usually translated as "perfection", or 
less commonly interpreted as "that which goes beyond".
